- "STEM majors were the **most common choice of gifted** students when they entered colleges (71%)."
- Looking at the main effects for the variables (school type, living location, gender, and race), it appears that **only gender had a significant difference in terms of STEM major choices.**
- Females were almost a 50/50 split, while males were about 80/20 for STEM majors versus non-STEM majors.

# Students’ reasons for STEM choices and the relationship of mathematics choice to university admission

- Students’ mathematics choices had a strong influence on the university admission outcomes. For instance, only 33% of the upper-secondary school graduates took the advanced mathematics ME test in 2013–2015, yet the number of those admitted to universities who had taken the advanced mathematics ME test was 55%. ***Supporting the above statement of "more gifted students tend to choose STEM.***
- The university students with advanced mathematics were mostly male. ***Also supporting the previous research.***
- Students who chose advanced mathematics believed in its usefulness for their future studies and careers.

- Senior high school students are generally interested in the field related to biology.
- The **alignment to the preferred course** in college is the primary reason of the participants enrolling in STEM. Almost all students wanted to pursue STEM-related careers after graduation.
- **Personal aspiration** is another reason. 
- Career guidance seminars or other related activities are also a reason.
- **Family** is also one of the strongest influences (the other one is personal aspiration).

  **Factors"**
  
  - **Gender (more men than women)**
  - Whether a STEM subject at school was favourite or not
    - Those who like STEM tend to choose STEM in the future.
    - Those who like science or math have higher possibility of choosing STEM. Those who like English have lower possibilities.
  - Belief in ability at maths, science and english.
    - Those who believed they were good at sci and math at age of 13/14 are more likely to choose STEM.
  - Belief that a STEM degree meant better pay or working longer hours
  - Belief that a STEM degree is in demand or required for chosen for a perticular career path
  - Main reason of going to university
  - Career plan
